Advanced Pseudo-classes & Pseudo-elements in CSS
Goals:
Use pseudo-classes to style specific elements based on their position 
or state
Use pseudo-elements to insert or style virtual parts of an element

 1. :nth-child()
Targets an element based on its position within its parent.

li:nth-child(2) {
  color: red; /* Only the second list item */
}

li:nth-child(odd) {
  background: #f0f0f0;
}

li:nth-child(3n) {
  font-weight: bold; /* Every third item */
}

2. :first-child
Targets the first child of a parent.

p:first-child {
  color: blue;
}

Only applies if the <p> is actually the first child of its parent.

3. ::before and ::after
These pseudo-elements let you insert virtual content before or after 
an elementâ€™s content.

.card::before {
  content: "ðŸ”¥ ";
  color: orange;
}

.card::after {
  content: " âœ”";
  color: green;
}

You can use these to:
Add decorative icons/symbols
Create tooltips, ribbons, or labels
Add quotes or dividers

Remember: ::before and ::after need content to be visible.
