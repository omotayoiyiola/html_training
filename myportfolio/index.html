        I am a good developer and I have handled a very tough project like the
        one described below
      </h2>

        Israel is still hitting targets in Iran, with “unprecedented force”,
        says its defence minister. But at the same time, it’s being reported
        here that the Israeli government has passed a message to Iran via its
        Arab neighbours that it is keen to wrap up the war in the next few days.
        Benjamin Netanyahu has said he’s not interested in a long war of
        attrition. Ten days of Iranian missiles, many of which have breached
        Israel’s defence shields, have caused fatalities and inflicted damage on
        buildings. And Israel is burning through its interceptors. Donald
        Trump’s posts after tonight’s Iranian attack perhaps suggest he’s not in
        the mood to step this up. That, coupled with Israel’s messaging, is
        beginning to look like a joint approach to Tehran to say: “enough is
        enough, we’re ready to stop if you are.” As ever, it’s hard to read an
        unpredictable White House – but the ball once again seems to be in
        Tehran’s court as to whether a severely weakened regime decides to call
        time on this war.
