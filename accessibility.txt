Absolutely! Making websites accessible is essential for ensuring everyone 
— including people with disabilities — can use your site. 
This is called Accessibility, often shortened to a11y 
(because there are 11 letters between "a" and "y").

Here are best practices for accessibility, focusing on ARIA roles, aria-* attributes, and keyboard navigation.
