2.  Meta Tags
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
<meta name="description" content="John Doe is a frontend developer specializing in React and UX design.">
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />

description: Shown in search result snippets
viewport: Ensures mobile responsiveness (Google ranks mobile-friendly sites higher)

3. Proper Use of Headings (<h1> to <h6>)
Use only one <h1> per page (usually the page title)
Organize other headings hierarchically like a table of contents

<h1>Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>E-commerce Site</h3>
  <h2>Contact</h2>

4. Alt Text for Images
Use descriptive alt attributes so:

Images are understandable by screen readers
Google Images can index your content
<img src="profile.jpg" alt="Profile photo of John Doe, web developer" />
